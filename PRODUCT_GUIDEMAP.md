# NextSeeker: Strategic Product Roadmap 2026 �
*From Tracking Tool to Career Success Engine*

This roadmap focuses on solving the high-friction, high-anxiety moments of the job search process through engineering excellence and strategic data management.

---

## � Core Strategy: The "Zero-Friction" Pipeline
Standard job hunting is fragmented across 10+ platforms. NextSeeker's value is in **unifying the fragmentation** and **automating the anxiety-inducing tasks**.

---

## � Phase 1: Data Integration & Automation (Months 1-3)
*Eliminating manual data entry to ensure 100% user retention.*

### 1.1 Universal Scraper Browser Extension (Chrome/Safari)
- **Granular Feature**: Auto-detect job listing fields (Title, Company, Salary, JD, URL) on LinkedIn, BizReach, Green, and Wantedly.
- **Killer Advantage**: "Partial Save" allows users to save a job while scrolling without leaving the page.
- **Impact**: Reduces the time to track 50 applications from 2 hours to 5 minutes.

### 1.2 "Email-to-Track" Integration (Parsed Inbound)
- **Granular Feature**: A dedicated `user-id@nextseek.online` email address. Users forward any job confirmation email (Amazon, Google, Recruit) to this address.
- **Killer Advantage**: Automatic parsing of interview dates/times from the email body into the NextSeeker dashboard.
- **Impact**: Guaranteed 100% accuracy in interview scheduling without opening the tool.

### 1.3 Application Status Automation
- **Granular Feature**: Periodic checking of career portal URLs saved by the user.
- **Impact**: Automatically notify the user if a status changes in the company's ATS (Workday, Greenhouse, etc.) if detectable.

## 📈 Phase 2: Strategic Interview Preparation (Months 4-6)
*Providing an "unfair advantage" in the selection process.*

### 2.1 The "Reverse Question" Database & Ranking
- **Granular Feature**: Built-in library of 100+ high-impact questions categorize by "Cultural Fit," "Business Health," and "Role Expectations."
- **Killer Advantage**: Ability to star and rank questions per application to ensure the most important ones are asked during limited time.
- **Impact**: Prevents "blank mind" at the end of interviews, ensuring the user looks 10x more prepared than other candidates.

### 2.2 JD-to-Goal Mapping (Alignment Scoring)
- **Granular Feature**: A scoring system (1-100) that measures how much a specific Job Description matches the user's previously set 3/5/10-year goals.
- **Impact**: Enables users to ruthlessly prioritize high-value applications and ignore "noise" that doesn't advance their career.

### 2.3 Preparation Checklist Templates
- **Granular Feature**: Auto-generated pre-interview tasks: "Company annual report check," "Review hiring manager LinkedIn," "Check recent news."
- **Impact**: Standardizes a high-performance preparation habit across every application.

---

## 💼 Phase 3: Post-Offer & Career Stewardship (Months 7-12)
*Extracting maximum value from successful applications.*

### 3.1 Offer Comparison & Negotiation Tool
- **Granular Feature**: side-by-side comparison of Base Salary, Bonus, RSUs, Benefits, and "Career Multiplier Score" for multiple offers.
- **Killer Advantage**: Negotiation scripts based on the specific strengths the user recorded in the "Feedback" notes of previous rounds.
- **Impact**: Directly increases the user's lifetime earnings through better negotiation data.

### 3.2 "Career History" Auto-Generator
- **Granular Feature**: Convert all successful tasks and project notes recorded in NextSeeker into a structured CV update.
- **Impact**: The user's resume is always "ready" for the next opportunity, even while they are happily employed.

### 3.3 Referral Network CRM
- **Granular Feature**: Tag recruiters and managers who provided high-quality feedback.
- **Impact**: When the user enters the market again in 2 years, they have a pre-warmed list of high-value contacts already in their CRM.

---

## � UX Design Tenets for NextSeeker
1. **Speed over Beauty**: The dashboard must load in <500ms. Career seekers are often in high-stress, low-time situations.
2. **Mobile Readiness**: 30% of status updates happen on the train or between meetings. The mobile PWA experience must match the desktop.
3. **Data Portability**: No "lock-in" anxiety. Users can export their entire career history to JSON/CSV at any time.
